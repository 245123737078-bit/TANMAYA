TANMAYA – AI Fashion Recommendation Web Application

TANMAYA is a smart, AI-powered fashion assistant designed to help users discover outfits, colors, and styles that truly suit them. The website uses image processing, color extraction, body shape identification, and style-matching logic to provide personalized fashion recommendations. The goal of the project is to simplify styling by giving users instant, accurate suggestions based on their skin tone, body shape, outfit preferences, and event type.

The application allows users to analyze their skin tone through the device camera, after which it detects warm, cool, or neutral undertones and suggests a suitable color palette. The system also includes a ShapeGuide feature that helps users identify their body shape—hourglass, pear, rectangle, or apple—and recommends outfits that enhance their natural proportions. For traditional wear, the platform suggests sarees, lehengas, kurtas, and other ethnic looks based on the user’s detected colors and shape. For western wear, users can explore modern clothing ideas that match their preferences and detected attributes. A HueMatcher tool further helps users create well-balanced outfit color combinations like contrast, pastel, monochrome, or complementary pairs.

The project follows a clean folder structure containing separate frontend and backend sections. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a gold-themed user interface, responsive design, and interactive pages. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, which handle routing and serve all frontend pages. Live camera input is processed using JavaScript to extract dominant colors, making the analysis fast and device-friendly.

TANMAYA aims to bridge fashion and technology by giving users an effortless styling experience. Whether choosing colors, selecting traditional outfits, exploring western trends, or matching jewelry, the system ensures every recommendation is tailored to the user's unique features. The project showcases a combination of web development, UI design, and AI-based decision logic to deliver a complete fashion recommendation system.
